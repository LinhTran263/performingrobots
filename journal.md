* Elusive
* Enjoy the murder scene as a source of entertainment
* Provide hints throughout the story for investigation, depending on the plot (some of them may be distraction/ raise suspicion towards him)
* The person who may say something that makes the other looks suspicious (he/she just enjoys the crack between members):
    * For example: A knife is found at the dead scene. This character may say: “I saw [a character’s name] walk towards the kitchen 10 minutes ago.”
* May have killed someone in the past by accident (?)
* Has difficulty with articulation, speaks in euphemism and allegory.
#### Character Description and Illustration:

#### Tools used:
* 2 motors
* 2 wheels + 2 elastic wrap-arounds
* 2 brackets
* M4 nuts and bolts
* M4x8 bolts
* M4x10 bolts
* Shredded wires (2 black and 2 red)
* Washers x 4 for each wheel attached on each motor; washers x 4 for each motor attached to the wood board
* 2 turning wheels

#### Steps taken:
* We started by soldering the shredded wires to the two motors as extensions. Then we cross-entangle the black and red wires to create one wire strand for each motor.
* Then we applied the brackets onto the motors. After that, we assembled the plastic wheels onto the motors using a screwdriver for the nuts, bolts, and washers, and got finished with them for the time being.

* Then on a piece of cut wood board, we used pencils to mark the positions where we will attach the bracketed and wheeled motors and the two small turning wheels.
* For drilling the middle hole, we used drill 9mm.
* For drilling the 4 holes to attach each bracket/motor to the wood board, we used drill 4.5mm.
* After we were done drilling holes, we attached the motors onto the board using M4 nuts and bolts with length 30mm, using the screwdriver and the socket wrench.

### 1 October 2024
#### Tool used:
* Arduino shield
* Motor shield
* Arduino board
* Motor
* Zip-ties
* Battery
* Nuts, bolts, and washers

#### Steps taken:
* We started with sawing the block of wood into two. We made sure that the height of the smaller wooden blocks + caster wheels is slightly less than the big turning wheels for it to wobble and move through the unsmooth surface.
![alt text](https://github.com/LinhTran263/performingrobots/blob/main/robot_illustration/1_10_1.jpeg)
* We drilled the wooden blocks into the base. Then we drill the caster wheels into the wooden blocks using 2 screws diagonally.

![alt text](https://github.com/LinhTran263/performingrobots/blob/main/robot_illustration/1_10_5.jpeg)
* Then we installed the arduino into the arduino shield and motor into the motor shield using the plastic nuts and bolts provided.
![alt text](https://github.com/LinhTran263/performingrobots/blob/main/robot_illustration/1_10_6.jpeg)
* Then we estimated the positions where we wanted to place the battery, the arduino, and the motor.
* We attached the battery onto the base with a few zip ties, tightly fixing them. We attached the motor and the arduino onto the base as well, but we drilled two holes diagonally under the arduino and motor shield to install the nuts and bolts.

#### Presentation Question (I presented today):
(toomie) - Given the advancement of technology, do you think the ultimate goal for creating humanoids is to achieve an existence identical to humans' existence? In other words, is it a good idea to consider robots the same as humans?

### 22 October 2024
* Arduino board
* Arduino board’s metal bracket
* L298 H-Bridge
* L298 H-Bridge’s plastic bracket
* Music Maker
* Shredded wires (1 yellow, 2 blue, 2 green, 1 white, 1 black)
* Pins for Motor Controller Arduino Shield
* Pins for L298 Breakout Board
* L298 Breakout Board
* Motor Controller Arduino Shield

We started by assembling and soldering all the pins to the Motor Controller Arduino Shield. Next, we cut out smaller 6 pins from a longer pin bracket and soldered it into the L298 Breakout Board. After that, we followed the connection table and soldered the corresponding colored shredded wires to the L298 Breakout Board. Then following the corresponding colored shredded wires, we connected the L298 Breakout Board with the Motor Controller Arduino Shield.

The Arduino has already been mounted to the metal bracket on the wooden base from last session. Likewise, the L298 H-Bridge has already been mounted to the metal bracket on the wooden base from last session.

Using the pins, we connected the L298 Breakout Board to the L298 H-Bridge and connected the Motor Controller Shield to the music maker that was placed onto the Arduino board. In doing so, we connected the L298 H-Bridge to the Arduino.

We finished up by using the screwdrivers to open up the wiring slots of the L298 H-Bridge and connected the motors to the L298 H-Bridge.

### 29 October 2024
First we typed the code and uploaded them onto the Arduino board with the power on for the wheels to run

We made sure to place something underneath the wooden base so that when the wheels turn, the base will not run away.

```
void setup() {
  // Pins 2 and 3 are connected to In1 and In2 respectively
  // of the L298 motor driver
  pinMode(9, OUTPUT); //en1
  pinMode(8, OUTPUT); //in1
  pinMode(7, OUTPUT); //in2

  pinMode(11, OUTPUT); //en2
  pinMode(10, OUTPUT); //in3
  pinMode(12, OUTPUT); //in4
}

void loop() {
  // make the motor turn in one direction
  digitalWrite(8, LOW);
  digitalWrite(7, HIGH);
  analogWrite(9, 254);
   // let it turn for 5 seconds
  digitalWrite(12, LOW);
  digitalWrite(10, HIGH);
  analogWrite(11, 200);}
```

We eyeballed the size of the head of our character (roughly the size of our group’s storage box). We used tape to attach 2 servo motors, Deluxe Hi-tec HS 422, to our prototype box. We used the sweep example from the application and made a few modifications to add another servo and made changes to the degree to test.

After that, we marked the 0 degree position as bookmarks on the motor of the servo motor.

### 05 November 2024

We built the skeleton for the robot’s body using the wood blocks provided and careful measurements.
![alt text](https://github.com/LinhTran263/performingrobots/blob/main/robot_illustration/1105_1.jpg)

Then we mounted the Arduino Mega onto the mounting box using the plastic standoffs and assembled them onto the robot body’s skeletons with drills.

Then we added the headers sockets for the RadioLink receiver on the nRF Servo Mega Shield. We installed the RadioLink receiver onto the nRF Servo Mega Shield.

We connected the two servo motors attached to the robot’s head to the Arduino Mega that’s been attached on the skeleton using servo wire extensions.

We used zinc to shape the hair of our robot and added wool to shape the texture.

### 12 November 2024
We cut the wood to build the left arm of the robot. It has the L shape.

Then we began building the cloche tray to place on top of the created L shape left arm. We built the skeleton for the cloche tray using cardboard and paper. We cut a cut-out circle into half, then built up the central skeleton. Then we started shaping the cloche tray using long pieces of cardboard arched around the central skeleton.

We cut out a cardboard circle to use as the base for the cloche tray.

We used a piece of fabric to cover the built skeleton of the cloche.

Then we cut out a long piece of wood to use as the stick that lifts up the cloche tray, and attached the stick to the cloche tray. Then we attached the servo motor onto the cut-out cardboard cloche tray base, and put everything together.

### 19 November 2024
On the music maker shield, we closed the three solder jumpers next to the ISP header.

We soldered the potentiometer to the Arduino_Shield_RC_Controller_v2 and plugged in the nRF24L01 radio module so that it extends away from the LCD.

To run the code, we changed the CUSTOM_ADDRESS_BYTE and CUSTOM_CHANNEL_NUMBER as our team’s assigned number.

On the Mega Arduino board, we plugged in the nRF24L01 radio module so that it extends over the edge of the board.

We drilled through the skeleton to install the two rods and the flanges onto the robot’s head, then attached the big servo to the skeleton, and then to the head to finish up making it moveable.

We attached the tray with the cloche made previously to the hand rising up, and connected it to the Mega Arduino board

We’ve managed to connect 4 servo motors or NeoPixel to the nRF Servo Mega Shield.

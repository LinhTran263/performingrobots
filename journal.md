#### Character inspiration:
* Hannibal Lecter: A cannibal psychological doctor from The Silence of the Lamb.
    * Mastermind, manipulative, enjoys understanding the complex of human thoughts and emotions.
* Lorraine Broughton: Top level MI6 secret intelligent service from Atomic Blond.
* Mayrin: A determined maid in an upper-class household in Black Butler anime.
#### Characteristic:
* Manipulative
* Elusive
* Enjoy the murder scene as a source of entertainment
* Provide hints throughout the story for investigation, depending on the plot (some of them may be distraction/ raise suspicion towards him)
* The person who may say something that makes the other looks suspicious (he/she just enjoys the crack between members):
    * For example: A knife is found at the dead scene. This character may say: “I saw [a character’s name] walk towards the kitchen 10 minutes ago.”
* May have killed someone in the past by accident (?)
* Has difficulty with articulation, speaks in euphemism and allegory.
#### Character Description and Illustration:
**For male design – Family doctor (see illustration below):**
* Character will have a big nose.
* Head will use a rectangular carton.
* The facial hair will use a scotch sponge.
* The rest of facial characteristics will be made by cartons including details.
* The body will be cartons.
* His blazer will be done using cartons and a layer of fabric.
* The leg and shoes will be the base of the robot for movements.

**For female design – Family maid (see illustration below)**
* Oval head shape – use a sack and fill it up to create the shape.
* The body will be cartons.
* The skirt/maid dress will use fabric.
* The leg and shoes will be the base of the robot for movements.
* For arms and legs, using cylindrical blocks of wood to support the whole body.

#### Tools used:
* 2 motors
* 2 wheels + 2 elastic wrap-arounds
* 2 brackets
* M4 nuts and bolts
* M4x8 bolts
* M4x10 bolts
* Shredded wires (2 black and 2 red)
* Washers x 4 for each wheel attached on each motor; washers x 4 for each motor attached to the wood board
* 2 turning wheels

#### Steps taken:
* We started by soldering the shredded wires to the two motors as extensions. Then we cross-entangle the black and red wires to create one wire strand for each motor.
* Then we applied the brackets onto the motors. After that, we assembled the plastic wheels onto the motors using a screwdriver for the nuts, bolts, and washers, and got finished with them for the time being.

* Then on a piece of cut wood board, we used pencils to mark the positions where we will attach the bracketed and wheeled motors and the two small turning wheels.
* For drilling the middle hole, we used drill 9mm.
* For drilling the 4 holes to attach each bracket/motor to the wood board, we used drill 4.5mm.
* After we were done drilling holes, we attached the motors onto the board using M4 nuts and bolts with length 30mm, using the screwdriver and the socket wrench.

### 1 October 2024
#### Tool used:
* Arduino shield
* Motor shield
* Arduino board
* Motor
* Zip-ties
* Battery
* Nuts, bolts, and washers

#### Steps taken:
* We started with sawing the block of wood into two. We made sure that the height of the smaller wooden blocks + caster wheels is slightly less than the big turning wheels for it to wobble and move through the unsmooth surface.

* We drilled the wooden blocks into the base. Then we drill the caster wheels into the wooden blocks using 2 screws diagonally.

* Then we installed the arduino into the arduino shield and motor into the motor shield using the plastic nuts and bolts provided.

* Then we estimated the positions where we wanted to place the battery, the arduino, and the motor.
* We attached the battery onto the base with a few zip ties, tightly fixing them. We attached the motor and the arduino onto the base as well, but we drilled two holes diagonally under the arduino and motor shield to install the nuts and bolts.

#### Presentation Question (I presented today):
(toomie) - Given the advancement of technology, do you think the ultimate goal for creating humanoids is to achieve an existence identical to humans' existence? In other words, is it a good idea to consider robots the same as humans?
